# üì∞„Ä°Discord Bot Status Changer 1.2.0

Heya! Thanks for looking into my status changer command! Using 1 command, you can change the online status of your bot, the activity type, and the name of your activity into just about anything you choose. (All within discord limitations, of course.)
- This is the first-ever app I've ever made, and bugs MAY happen. So if you run into any bugs, please lemme know! Contact info is down below! 

### ‚Ä£ üìã Setup 
1. Click Install Free.
2. Link your discord bot resource.
3. Set Your Dependencies (The Guild ID, and the ID of the role you want to run the command, like an admin role for example) and install the app, and you should be good to go!!

### ‚Ä£ ‚öôÔ∏è How The Command Works
Use the command `/status [status] [type] [name] [url]`, it will set the status to what you selected.
- With [status], you can choose between Online, Idle, Do Not Disturb, or Offline.
- With [type], you can set the activity type to Watching, Playing, Listening, Competing, or Streaming.
- With [name], anything you put will show up after the activity type. Probably best to not make it ridiculously long tho.
- With [url], any URL you place in will show up as a button. Recommend to only use while the Streaming type is selected.
